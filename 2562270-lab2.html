            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Nonhlanhla Sindane, a third-year Computer Science student at Wits University with a strong passion for coding and technology. I am focused on improving my skills, especially in software development, and enjoy tackling challenging problems. Outside of academics, I’m dedicated to fitness, specifically strength training and calisthenics, and I strive for a balanced, healthy lifestyle. I’m also interested in non-fiction, particularly true crime and investigative topics. My goal is to continue growing in both tech and personal development while building a solid foundation for my career in the tech industry.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>For my latest project, I developed a Snake game using Java. The game allows the player to control the snake's movements, collect food to grow longer, and avoid running into walls or itself. This project helped me enhance my skills in programming logic, working with 2D arrays, and handling user input in real-time. It also gave me experience with graphical user interfaces (GUI) through the use of the pygame library. I enjoyed tackling the challenge of improving the game's functionality and user experience, and I plan to add more features in the future, like multiple levels and a high-score tracker.</p>
